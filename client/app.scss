/ / This code makes use of attribute selectors. They aren't as common so here is a
/ / quick rundown. There are seven types, are case-sensitive, and use brackets.
/ /
/ / [data-value] { data attribute simply exists on any element }
/ / a[href="http://google.com"] { href attribute has the exact web address }
/ /
/ / [data-value="foo"] { data attribute has the exact value of "foo" }
/ / [data-value*="foo"] { data attribute has the value "foo" somewhere in it }
/ / [data-value~="foo"] { data attribute has the value "foo" in a space-separated list }
/ / [data-value^="foo"] { data attribute starts with the value of "foo" }
/ / [data-value|="foo"] { data attribute starts with "foo" in a dash-separated list }
/ / [data-value$="foo"] { data attribute ends with the value of "foo" }

// it's important to only include what we need, tools like Purify CSS etc.
// don't work well with dynamic JavaScript so we don't use them, as such
// it's important to be meticulous as to what gets included in the app
// never do a blanket include like importing '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap'

// these includes are always required and should be included in this order
@import '~bootstrap/scss/functions';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/variables';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/mixins';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/reboot';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/root';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/type';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/utilities';

// import the optional bootstrap modules we want, refer to
// ~bootstrap/scss/ for a full list of available modules
@import '~bootstrap/scss/breadcrumb';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/tooltip';

// these are core styles and should be included in this order
@import 'styles/variables';
